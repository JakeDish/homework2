First, the main text of the site was added, including "hipster ipsom" to fill space in the "About Me" section.

Next, images were added to the "work" section as placeholders since no real applications exist to fill this section. I chose a theme somewhat at random and added the images

Lastly, contact info was added

On the CSS side, I selected coloring similar to that of VSCode itself with dark backgrounds and text- this does not create that most appealing visuals but it does act as a psuedo-dark mode which is (to me) easier on the eyes than bright whites and blues.

Surprisingly, the most challenging part of this assignment for me was ensuring that the section titles and content appeared next to each other, for example having the "About Me" text on the left while the content appeared on the right without overlapping other sections. This was likely due to handling of parent and child classes. The classes as they exist could likely use consolidation but for the time being they function as intended.

I added a "hover" effect using psuedo-classes which effectively highlights an image when the cursor is on top of it and the "Work" section images are responsive to screen size changes.
